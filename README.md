# npm library package

This is a very minimal project template for library code that can be deployed to npm. It's based on [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).

## Usage

- Clone or fork this repository, or create a new repository using this as a template.
- Build your code using `npm run build`.
- You can deploy your package any way you want.
